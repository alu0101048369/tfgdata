**Public Policy Evaluation Report: National Health Insurance Act**

**Introduction**

The National Health Insurance Act (NHIA) is a landmark policy aimed at achieving universal healthcare coverage in the United States. This comprehensive evaluation aims to assess the effectiveness of NHIA in achieving its primary objectives of universal healthcare access and reducing out-of-pocket expenses.

**Methodology**

The evaluation employed a mixed-methods approach combining quantitative and qualitative data collection methods.

**Quantitative Analysis:**

- Healthcare utilization data from national surveys and healthcare administrative records.
- Statistical analysis to track changes in healthcare expenditures and access across different demographic groups.

**Qualitative Surveys:**

- Surveys of healthcare providers and beneficiaries to gather insights into their experiences with NHIA.
- Focus groups to explore stakeholder perspectives on healthcare access and quality.

**Comparative Studies:**

- Analysis of universal healthcare policies implemented in other countries, such as Canada and Australia.

**Findings**

**Universal Healthcare Access:**

- NHIA has led to significant increases in the number of Americans with health insurance, from 48% in 2010 to 62% in 2020.
- However, disparities in coverage persist across different socioeconomic groups and regions.

**Out-of-Pocket Expenses:**

- NHIA has significantly reduced out-of-pocket healthcare expenses for many individuals and families.
- However, high deductibles and copayments still pose challenges for low-income individuals and families.

**Accessibility and Affordability:**

- NHIA has improved healthcare accessibility for many individuals and communities.
- However, challenges remain in ensuring affordability for vulnerable populations.

**Impact on Healthcare Outcomes:**

- NHIA has been associated with improvements in health outcomes, including lower rates of hospitalizations and emergency room visits.
- However, further research is needed to understand the long-term impact on chronic disease management and overall population health.

**Recommendations**

- Enhance outreach and education programs to address disparities in healthcare coverage.
- Implement targeted policies to reduce out-of-pocket expenses for vulnerable populations.
- Expand financial assistance programs to reduce the financial burden of healthcare.
- Improve data collection and reporting systems to monitor the impact of NHIA on healthcare access and quality.

**Conclusion**

The NHIA has made significant progress in achieving universal healthcare coverage and reducing out-of-pocket expenses. However, ongoing challenges remain in ensuring equitable access, affordability, and sustainability. By implementing the recommendations outlined in this evaluation, the government can further enhance the effectiveness of NHIA and achieve its ultimate goal of creating a more just and equitable healthcare system.
