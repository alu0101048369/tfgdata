RECOMMENDS HEREBY:
(1)
    Member States, the Council, the Commission and, where appropriate, the European External Action Service (‘EEAS’) and relevant Union bodies, offices and agencies should cooperate with each other in the framework of the EU Critical Infrastructure Blueprint contained in this Recommendation, in order to achieve the objectives set out in Section 1 of Part I of the Annex and should, taking account of the principles set out in Section 2 of Part I of the Annex, provide a coordinated response to critical infrastructure incidents with significant cross-border relevance.
(2)
    Member States, the Council, the Commission and, where appropriate, the EEAS and relevant Union bodies, offices and agencies should apply the EU Critical Infrastructure Blueprint without undue delay, whenever a critical infrastructure incident with significant cross-border relevance occurs and as long as the Member State hosting the affected critical infrastructure is in agreement. In the context of this EU Critical Infrastructure Blueprint, a critical infrastructure incident with significant cross-border relevance takes place when an incident involving critical infrastructure has one of the following effects:
    (a)
        a significant disruptive effect on the provision of essential services, as assessed by six or more affected Member States, and communicated to the Presidency of the Council and to the Commission;
    (b)
        a significant disruptive effect on the provision of essential services by a critical entity of particular European significance within the meaning of Article 17 of Directive (EU) 2022/2557 of the European Parliament and of the Council (13), as assessed by the affected Member State(s), and communicated to the Presidency of the Council and to the Commission; or
    (c)
        a significant disruptive effect on the provision of essential services to or in two or more Member States, where in agreement with the affected Member States and in consultation with the Commission, the Presidency of the Council assesses that timely coordination in the response at Union level is required, due to, for instance, the incident’s wide-ranging and significant impact of technical or political relevance.


Summary:
Member States, the Council, the Commission and, where appropriate, the EEAS and relevant Union bodies should cooperate to achieve the objectives set out in Section 1 of Part I of the Annex by providing a coordinated response to critical infrastructure incidents with significant cross-border relevance. The EU Critical Infrastructure Blueprint should be applied without undue delay when such incidents occur.
