RECOMMENDS HEREBY:
(1)
    Member States, the Council, the Commission and, where appropriate, the European External Action Service (‘EEAS’) and relevant Union bodies, offices and agencies should cooperate with each other in the framework of the EU Critical Infrastructure Blueprint contained in this Recommendation, in order to achieve the objectives set out in Section 1 of Part I of the Annex and should, taking account of the principles set out in Section 2 of Part I of the Annex, provide a coordinated response to critical infrastructure incidents with significant cross-border relevance.
(2)
    Member States, the Council, the Commission and, where appropriate, the EEAS and relevant Union bodies, offices and agencies should apply the EU Critical Infrastructure Blueprint without undue delay, whenever a critical infrastructure incident with significant cross-border relevance occurs and as long as the Member State hosting the affected critical infrastructure is in agreement. In the context of this EU Critical Infrastructure Blueprint, a critical infrastructure incident with significant cross-border relevance takes place when an incident involving critical infrastructure has one of the following effects:
    (a)
        a significant disruptive effect on the provision of essential services, as assessed by six or more affected Member States, and communicated to the Presidency of the Council and to the Commission;
    (b)
        a significant disruptive effect on the provision of essential services by a critical entity of particular European significance within the meaning of Article 17 of Directive (EU) 2022/2557 of the European Parliament and of the Council (13), as assessed by the affected Member State(s), and communicated to the Presidency of the Council and to the Commission; or
    (c)
        a significant disruptive effect on the provision of essential services to or in two or more Member States, where in agreement with the affected Member States and in consultation with the Commission, the Presidency of the Council assesses that timely coordination in the response at Union level is required, due to, for instance, the incident’s wide-ranging and significant impact of technical or political relevance.
(3)
    The relevant actors of the EU Critical Infrastructure Blueprint, identified at operational, strategic/political levels in accordance with Section 3 of Part I of the Annex, should endeavour to interact and cooperate in complementarity. They should ensure the adequate and timely exchange of relevant information, including coordination of public communication and coordination of the response set out in Part II of the Annex.
(4)
    The EU Critical Infrastructure Blueprint should be applied having regard to and in coherence with other relevant instruments, in accordance with Section 4 of Part I of the Annex. In case an incident affects both physical aspects and the cybersecurity of critical infrastructure, coordination and synergies with the provisions for coordinated management of large-scale cybersecurity incidents provided for by Directive (EU) 2022/2555 of the European Parliament and of the Council (14) should be ensured.
(5)
    Member States should ensure that they effectively respond, at national level, and in accordance with Union law, to disruptions of critical infrastructure following significant critical infrastructure incidents, whether they have significant cross-border relevance or not.
(6)
    Member States, the Council, the EEAS, the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation (‘Europol’) and other relevant Union agencies, as well as the Commission, should designate or establish a point of contact for matters relating to the EU Critical Infrastructure Blueprint. Information should be handled in accordance with established procedures and regulations, including the handling of classified information. The points of contact should support the application of the EU Critical Infrastructure Blueprint by providing necessary information and facilitate coordination measures responding to a significant critical infrastructure incident. For Member States, where possible, those points of contact should be the same as the single points of contact to be designated or established pursuant to Article 9(2) of Directive (EU) 2022/2557.


Summary:
The EU Critical Infrastructure Blueprint provides a framework for cooperation and coordination in the event of critical infrastructure incidents with significant cross-border relevance. Member States, the Council, the Commission and the EEAS should cooperate to achieve the objectives set out in the Blueprint. The Blueprint should be applied without undue delay and whenever a critical infrastructure incident with significant cross-border relevance occurs. The relevant actors of the Blueprint should interact and cooperate to ensure the adequate and timely exchange of information. The Blueprint should be applied in coherence with other relevant instruments and in case of incidents affecting both physical aspects and cybersecurity, coordination with large-scale cybersecurity incidents is required. Member States should ensure effective national responses to critical infrastructure disruptions following significant incidents.
